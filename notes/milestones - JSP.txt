COMPILABLE TASK
I created a first draft of roomgen.cpp, the program that randomly generates the rooms for each game and how they're connected.

GITHUB REPOSITORY
https://github.com/frozensriracha/CS302-Final-Project

RUBRIC
20 points - proof of each group member's contribution
10 - Uses a data structure learned in CS302

5 - Code compiles, is well formatted, has comments.

REPORT
At first, we struggled with the direction in which to take the project; we only came up with a plan on Saturday. While I didn't have many issues writing the C++ code, we will be learning Unity, so I expect there to be a learning curve with it.

NEXT STEPS
Next, we plan on learning Unity to create some basic graphics for our game. Our first priority is being able to maneuver through the rooms, our second priorities being combat, varying levels of difficulty, and objects.
