COMPLIABLE TASK:

GROUP REPOSITORY:
		  https://github.com/frozensriracha/CS302-Final-Project


RUBRIC:
		  20 points - dedication to project, proof of code, proof of time log, proof of multiple group meetings
		  10 points - Uses data structure from CS302
		  10 points - code/project works as intended, code is well commented

REPORT:
		  The most difficult dilemma our group ran into was generating an idea for the project. We finally decided to
		  create a dungeon-style game, where a player moves through a maze that consists of "rooms" full of different
		  kinds of enemies. Enemies must be destroyed before a player can move out of the room. Once the boss room is
		  found and the boss is killed, the player wins the game. Apart from generating ideas for this project,
		  Challenge Five went very well, and all group member greatly contributed to this challenge.

PLANS: 
		  My team plans on working with Unity next, because our plan is to make the game using this game engine.
		  We plan on working on a base difficulty of the game with very basic maneuvers, before moving to add enemy
		  drops, different difficulty levels, etc. We hope to complete our basic version of the game by the end of
		  October/beginning of November.
