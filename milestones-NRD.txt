Report:
We struggled to find a direction for this final project, and only decided on a development
direction on Saturday. Now that we have a direction, we have quickly set off on the basic aspects
of the game's design rather than focusing on the the code/technical aspects of the challenge since
Unity is new to all of us and we did not have time to learn the environment together AND develop
a deliverable aspect individually. After fall break, our next steps will be familiarizing ourselves
with Unity as well as working on the basic aspects of room generation in cpp.
