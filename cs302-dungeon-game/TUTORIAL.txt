TUTORIAL

	Battle for Benevolence is a single-player RPG that uses graphs to generate
a series of rooms with different types of enemies. To win, the player needs to defeat
all the enemies in each of the rooms. There will be 10 rooms generated, ending with
a boss room, but the map can create any number of dead ends and false paths as well.
There are multiple different types of enemies the player will encounter, those being
globs (light enemies), snipers (medium, long range enemies), bruisers (heavy but slow
enemies,) and the boss. The game is won by defeating all enemies including the boss.
If enemies deal enough damage to the player, they die and the game is lost.

	Use the W, S, A and D keys to move your character up, down, left, and right,
respectively. To shoot, press the left button on your mouse. To move to the next room,
all enemies must be defeated. A random number of entrances and exits are generated in
each room, with some leading to dead ends. The player is able to backtrack and return
to a previously visited room. In that case, enemies will not respawn.
