Description: This is the "rooms" txt file, which explains the room designs for the game. The "ALL ROOMS" section
             describes the rules that all rooms must follow. The following sections are different rooms that will
			 generate. The base model will have at least 10-15 rooms that will generate. Nick's drawings and Ryan's
			 enemy description will help to describe the enemies and room designs in a more technical way.



ALL ROOMS:
- must destroy all enemies before leaving/changing rooms, can leave from entrance afterwards and backtrack as well
- Keep in mind, only working with a "base" difficulty for now, add more difficulties later, of which the enemy count is   scaled.
- Room sizes are thought of as groups of "tiles" (aka 2 tiles by 2 tiles -> 2X2)
- Rooms can generate in any orientation

GLOB ROOM:
- Room full of just globs
- 2X2 room
- strategy to beat room is to run in circles, destroying enemies
- running in room slows down player (insinuates glob slowdown)
- Base Difficulty: 4 Globs
- One entrance, one exit (dead end), see Nick's Drawing

SNIPER ROOM:
- 3X4 (grand corridor)
- lesser enemies surround snipers, which are located in the backend of the room
- multiple demons, soldiers
- Base Difficulty: 2 snipers, 4 demons, 2 soldiers
- Player enters on 3 tile side
- Up to four possible exits, one per side, see Nick's Drawing
- Lights turn on and off, which reveal enemies "sometimes", which makes this room more difficult
