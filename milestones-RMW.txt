Report
	The biggest challenge for our group so far was coming up with an idea for this project. Nic, Mabry, Jules and I
	spent an entire 2 hour meeting brainstorming ideas before we settled on a dungeon crawler. Once this idea was decided, 
	we were able to divide tasks up evenly. From this point forward, all group members contributed equally, and Challenge 
	5 was a success.

Tasks
	Our first task is to learn how to use Unity as a group. We plan to use the Unity game engine to build this game. Once
	we are comfortable with Unity, we can begin to create the game from the ground up. The current plan is to make a base version of	the game, then begin to implement features until the game is complete.
